Started The project of tracking Covid-19 in India, March 20 2019 onwards. I decided to collect the Data from the health ministry site mohfw.gov.in by Web Scraping.
That gave me the name of the states , National and foreigners count who had covid19, The migrated/recovered numbers and total Deaths. Initially my approach was to visualize and explore the data available to me by using plotly and various other libraries in python.
One complete notbook Spread of covid-19 in india that visualizes the data of Covid Cases as of 21 March 2020. 
but as the cases began to grow i wanted to find answers to the following questions.
1) Which is the most affected state in India
2) The trend of Total Covid-19 Cases in India
3) How Fast was the virus spreading in India
4) What the spread looks like on the map
5) Make comparison to different countries.
6) Approach that some countries followed
